A handsome man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss. When the boss came, the story began.

-The client: is room 39 empty?
-The boss: yes, sir.
-The client: can I book it?
-The boss: of course you can.
-The client: thank you.

Before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.

The boss agreed though he was surprized at the weird things the client asked to have.

The client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.

Unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.

After midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. Voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.

The boss didn't sleep that night. He kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.

In the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the latter asked to see the room first.

He went to the room and found everything alright. Nothing unusual. He even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.

The client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.

The boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. In fact, he started to doubt himself.

After one year, the client showed up again. He asked to see the boss again. The boss was in a puzzle.

The client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 79g.

This time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. He spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. After midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.

Again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. The smile didn't leave his face.

The boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. Why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife??? In fact, the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.

The boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of March, the month in which the client showed up. 

To his surprise, on the first day of March, the same client showed up. He asked the same questions. Wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.

The boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.

In the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.

-''If I tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''
-''I promise I will never let anyone know''.
-''Swear''
-''I swear I won't reveal your secret''
So finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss. 

Unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. Until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.

When he does, I will let you know... thank you for reading.

Two beggars are sitting side by side on a street in Rome.

One has a cross in front of him; the other one the Star of David. Many people go by and look at both beggars, but only put money into the hat of the beggar sitting behind the cross.

A priest comes by, stops and watches throngs of people giving money to the beggar behind the cross, but none give to the beggar behind the Star of David.

Finally, the priest goes over to the beggar behind the Star of David and says, "My poor fellow, don't you understand? This is a Catholic country; this city is the seat of Catholicism. People aren't going to give you money if you sit there with a Star of David in front of you, especially when you're sitting beside a beggar who has a cross. In fact, they would probably give to him just out of spite."

The beggar behind the Star of David listened to the priest, turned to the other beggar with the cross and said: "Moishe, look who's trying to teach the Goldstein brothers about marketing."

The CIA wanted to introduce a spy into Russia. They figured he’d have to be able to speak perfect Russian, drink massive amounts of vodka without passing out, and play the balalaika. They finally found one volunteer who could do all three and sent him to Moscow.

When he arrived he found the Russian equivalent of a bar and started talking to the bartender in perfect colloquial Russian. After a few minutes the bartender said, “You’re not Russian.”

“Not Russian?” said the agent. “Watch this.” He guzzled a couple of liters of vodka without showing any effect. “Very impressive,” said the bartender, “but you’re not Russian.”

“How can you doubt me?” asked the agent. “Watch this.” He took a balalaika from the wall and played a succession of Russian folk songs perfectly. “You play great,” said the bartender, “but you’re not Russian.”

“I speak perfect Russian, play the balalaika, and guzzle vodka as only a Russian can,” said the agent. “How can you say I’m not Russian?”

“There are no black Russians.”

A dog walks into a butcher shop with a purse strapped around his neck. He walks up to the meat case and calmly sits there until it's his turn to be helped. A man, who was already in the butcher shop, finished his purchase and noticed the dog. The butcher leaned over the counter and asked the dog what it wanted today. The dog put its paw on the glass case in front of the ground beef, and the butcher said, "How many pounds?" 

The dog barked twice, so the butcher made a package of two pounds ground beef. 
He then said, "Anything else?" 
The dog pointed to the pork chops, and the butcher said, "How many?" 
The dog barked four times, and the butcher made up a package of four pork chops. 
The dog then walked around behind the counter, so the butcher could get at the purse. The butcher took out the appropriate amount of money and tied two packages of meat around the dog's neck. 

The man, who had been watching all of this, decided to follow the dog. It walked for several blocks and then walked up to a house and began to scratch at the door to be let in. 
As the owner opened the door, the man said to the owner, "That's a really smart dog you have there." 
The owner said, "He's not really all that smart. This is the second time this week he forgot his key."

I was feeling a little down yesterday...Then the bastards threw me out of the special learning school.


-This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My rifle is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.
My rifle, without me, is useless. Without my rifle, I am useless. I must fire my rifle true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will...
My rifle and I know that what counts in war is not the rounds we fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit...
My rifle is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. I will keep my rifle clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...
Before God, I swear this creed. My rifle and I are the defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.
So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy, but peace!

- Jak puścisz bąka, to ściągamy staniki.
Gość zdziwiony troszkę, niemniej baką sprzedał.
Dziewczyny zgodnie z umową ściągnęły staniki.
Pojawiła się następna propozycja:
- Jak jeszcze raz puścisz baką, to ściągamy majtki.
Gość: prrrruuuuuukkk.
- A teraz jak puścisz serię bąków, to będziesz mógł nas podotykać.
No to gościu: prrruk, prrrruuuuuuk, brrrrruk, pruk, pierrrrrd i nagle słyszy:
- Kowalski, k!%!a, nie dość, że śpicie na zebraniu, to jeszcze pierdzicie!!!

Poruchik Rzhevsky asks his batman: "Stepan, there is a grand ball tonight. Got any new puns for me to tell there?" — "Sure, sir, how about this rhyme: 'Adam had Eve... right on the eve... of their very last day in Eden...'" — "That's a good one!". Later, at the ball: "Monsieurs, monsieurs! My Stepan taught me a funny chanson ridicule: 'Adam boinked Eve at dawn...' Pardon, not like that... 'Adam and Eve fuck through the night ...' Er... Hell, basically they fuck, but it was absolutement splendid in verse!"

Dielo on talvel. Lähtöü Kindahan mužikki Priäžäh goštih. Toizet sanotah hänel, štobi tiijustas, mida ruadoloi nügöi Priažäs ruatah. (Huigei on joga kerdu mennä küzümäh, priäžän tahvas nagretah). Meni mužikki Priäžäh, a sie ühtes talois mužikal hebo töllöi, hebuo n'ülgöü?! Kindahan mužikki sanou:
— Jumal abu ruadajal!
— Hüvä abu, - vastuau toine.
Mužikki ei voi tipua, küzüü:
— Midäbo, - sanou, — nügöi talvel vevon aigah sinä hevon tapoit?
— A, - sanou, — hevonnahku on nügöi Petroskois kallis. Ühten hevon nahkas mondu hebuo voibo ostua. Meil pošti kai hevot iškiettih.
Mužikki punaldih ülen terväh iäre kodih. Tuli kodih, ommassah hevon iškeldu, rubei n'ülgömäh. (Eule aigua toizil sanuo). Tuldih külän mužikat.
— Midäbo näit sie? - küzütäh.
A nügöi, - sanou, - Priäžäs heboloi iškietäh, hevonnahku on Petroskois kallis.
Dai minä iškin hevon, lähten nahkan müön, ostan mondu hebuo sijah!
Davai hüö kogo kylän väil heboloi iškemäh.
Tuli kevät, a heil ni ühtü hebuo, ei mil kündiä. Keviäl künnettih da ruadoloi ruattih.

En kyckling och en häst var ute och gick. Plötsligt föll hästen ner i ett stort hål. "Hjälp! Hjälp! Hämta bonden!" ropade hästen. "Det är lugnt" sade kycklingen. Kycklinen sprang hem till bondgården och hämtade bondens BMW. Han kom tillbaka drog upp hästen ur hålet. En vecka senare var dom ute och gick, igen, när kycklingen plötsligt föll ner i ett stort hål. "Hjälp! Hjälp! Hämta bonden!" ropade kycklingen. "Det är lugnt" sade hästen. Hästen ställde sig över hålet och fällde ner sitt "trollspö" för att dra upp kycklingen. Vad har vi lärt oss av detta? Jo, If you have a huge dick you don't need a fancy car to pick up some chicks!
